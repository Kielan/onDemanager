React.js Boilerplate Example
I've decided to make a nifty web app using v3 of the the react.js biolerplate by max aka @mxstbr for reference. I plan to document the code well to explain some key concepts of both the package and react/redux... eventually

The app itself is a dashboard app with search, collapsable sidebar, login system to an api service, management of creatable cards and a newsfeed
